# Final-Project
Team name: Dank Dogs
Team members: Ava Carragher ajc341@pitt.edu, Torrie Cecchetti vlc30@pitt.edu
We used data sets about number of dog liscences, fatal overdoses, and amount of private school in different zip codes in Pittsburgh. We think the best neighborhood will have the highest number of dogs, and lowest number of private schools and overdoses. 
Our data sets are: 
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-fatal-accidental-overdoses
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-dog-licenses
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-private-schools-locations
Overview: Our repository includes 3 data sets, 3 notesbooks in which we read through the data sets, and 1 final notebook on our thoughts on what the data showed.
